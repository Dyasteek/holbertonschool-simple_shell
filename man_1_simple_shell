.SH NAME
    shellyBean - Holberton Simple Shell: command line interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
shellyBean

.SH DESCRIPTION
    .B shellyBean
    is a basic command line interpreter that reads and executes commands from user input,
    functioning similarly to a shell.
.PP
    .B shellyBean
    is compiled on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with gcc and runs in interactive mode only.
.PP
.SH USER INPUT
    When a user enters a command and presses Enter, the shell performs the following actions:

    1. Displays a prompt (shellyBean$) and waits for user input.
    2. Reads the command using getline().
    3. Tokenizes the command into arguments using strtok() with delimiters: space, newline, tab.
    4. Checks if the command is a built-in command.
    5. If not built-in, executes the command using fork() and execve() with absolute path.
.PP
.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
    .IP env
    Displays the PATH environment variable.
    .IP exit
    Terminates the shell process and frees allocated memory.
    .IP end of file
    Alternative exit command that terminates the shell.
    .IP EOF
    Alternative exit command that terminates the shell.
    .IP eof
    Alternative exit command that terminates the shell.
.PP
.SH EXTERNAL COMMANDS
    The shell can execute external commands that are specified with their full path (e.g., /bin/ls).
    Commands must be provided with their complete path as the shell does not search in PATH.
.PP
.SH ERROR HANDLING
    When a command is not found, the shell displays an error message in the format:
    "shell: [line_number]: [command]: not found"
.PP
.SH MEMORY MANAGEMENT
    The shell manages memory allocation and deallocation:
    - Uses malloc() for dynamic memory allocation
    - Frees allocated memory before normal exit
    - Frees memory in child process on execution errors
.PP
.SH SIGNAL HANDLING
    The shell can be terminated using Ctrl+C (SIGINT).
    When terminated abruptly, some memory may remain allocated.
.PP
.SH EXIT CODES
    - 0: Successful execution
    - 1: Command not found or execution error
.PP
.SH LIMITATIONS
    - Maximum of 1024 arguments per command
    - Only supports interactive mode
    - Commands must be specified with full path
    - Limited built-in command support
